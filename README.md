This is some jQuery/JavaScript that I wrote to turn the Ingress Passcodes into the Passcodes that you use to get supplies to the game.

##How Does This Thing Work?
Well, It's a webpage and pretty simple one at that. You open it in your browser. It is not supported in Internet Explorer 9 or before. <a href="http://decodeingress.me/2014/01/28/passcode-decoding-walkthrough-0001-1/" target="_blank">You can read the whole thing here</a>. It talks about the whole thing, and explains a little bit about. Really, it's pretty nerdy and I only understand half of it myself. But hey, any excuse to write some JavaScript, right?

###Directions...
1. Download the code
2. Stick into a webpage
3. Open the web page
4. Consume all media associated with a game that pull you away from all those you hold dear for a poorly visible alpha-numeric code that you wouldn't really notice if you were a casual viewer.
5. Closely inspect that media 53 more times just to make sure you didn't miss that code.
6. Do you stink? When was the last time you took a shower. Or shaved. Maybe you should do that. What time is it?
7. Jeez. It's daylight out. Have I been up all night? Well, at least I can go to the park now to play more Ingress.
